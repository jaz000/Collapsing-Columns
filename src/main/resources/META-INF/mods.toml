This mod prevents players from making poles of a 1x1 block formation into the sky to get to ledges, slime islands, tops of trees, etc.

It defaults to checking for 10 blocks on a pole, if no other block supports the pole it will be destroyed.

A whitelist is available to allow you to add scaffolding blocks and whatever else you think is fine. I recommend sand and gravel because you use a torch to take them down fast!

If ever you think it's not working, turn on the debug mode.
